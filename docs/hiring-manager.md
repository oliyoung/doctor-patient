### Email the candidate

Hey XXX,

The next step in our process is an offline exercise. We will invite you to a GitHub repository with the exercise. Review of your exercise is intended to be anonymous -- please do not put any of your contact details in the repository. We will rebase and force push your commits upon submission. The exercise is intended to only take 60-90 minutes after initial setup and the subsequent pairing exercise will build upon this repository. The instructions for the exercise is in the repository.

The exercise is very new and we'll be iterating on it over time to improve it. Please take notes of anything that is unclear or works other than expected. When you are finished or if you have questions please email us at engineering-hiring@orderlymeds.com

Best Regards,
Patrick & Elle

## Clean up

Warning: Do not do this until we've made a decision on the candidate as the repository is used in the next step in the hiring process.
