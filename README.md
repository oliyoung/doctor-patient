## Exercise: Implementing a Patient Portal using Ruby on Rails with Turbo

### Objective

Design and implement a functional patient portal application using Ruby on Rails.
The portal will allow patients to:

- see their profile and next appointment,
- adjust their next appointment schedule, and
- view their medical records.

The exercise will focus on using Turbo to create a smooth, single-page application experience.

### Requirements:

1. Patient Dashboard:

Create a dashboard that displays an overview of the patientâ€™s information:

- Personal details (name, age, contact information)
- Next appointment data -- read and update
- Recent medical records (e.g., last visit summary)

Implement this dashboard using Turbo
to ensure a seamless, real-time update experience without full-page reloads.
